        We are a community of runners that combine getting fit with doing good.
        We stop off on our runs to do manual labour for community organisations
        and to support isolated older people with social visits and one-off
        tasks they can't do on their own.
        It's a great way to get fit, meet new people and do some good.
        As long as you're up for getting sweaty, everyone's welcome.

        why not get fit by accident?

        Why burn energy in the gym when you could harness that effort to
        spruce up public spaces, or visit lonely pensioners?

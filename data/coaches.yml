  :description: "I’ve never been a morning exerciser, I always felt heavy and sluggish first thing. Being paired up with Connie has given me that motivation to start the day with a run. Getting to know her has been a breeze compared to the run there!"

  :description: The first question Flo asks me every Friday morning when I turn up at her flat is, “Do you know me?" This is then normally followed by “How did you know I was here?” I tell her that I have known her for 4 months and that I come every Friday especially to visit her.
